                        <p>I am a full stack web software developer with backend emphasis. Solving difficult technical and mathematical problems is what really lights my fire but I also claim that I have an excellent business brain right next to that mathematical part. Thus my dream is to work in a start-up company with a technically challenging innovative product.</p>

                        <p class="ingress"><a class="out" href="http://plus.cs.hut.fi">A+</a> is an open-source educational platform developed by the research group <a class="out" href="http://cse.aalto.fi/research/groups/letech/">LeTech</a> (Learning+Technology) of <a class="out" href="http://www.aalto.fi/en/">Aalto University School of Science</a>. The abstract idea of A+ is to hide the different technical requirements for different courses and thus reduce the number of educational services that students have to deal with during their studies.</p>
                        <p class="ingress">I was hired as a research assistant in LeTech. My job was to deploy A+ to be used on two courses in Aalto and to develop it further as new requirements emerged and as bugs and weaknesses were discovered.</p>
                        <p class="ingress">The use and development of A+ continues by the LeTech group. The code is hosted in <a class="out" href="https://github.com/Aalto-LeTech/a-plus">GitHub</a>.</p>

                        <h3>Scalability and Plug-ins with Django</h3>
                        <p>The main focus of my work with A+ was on the Django back-end. Several scalability issues were found as there has been hundred thousand exercise submissions to the service after the initial launch. I gained deep understanding in ORM while solving those database-related issues.</p>
                        <p>Another big thing I did, was designing and implementing a plug-in architecture for A+ to allow the research group to build plug-ins related to educational research.</p>

                        <p>The deployment and maintenance of A+ and separate grading services lead me to work with the Linux command line. For example, I learned to manage linux processes and permissions for secure Apache-based web server which was crucial as we had run student-written programs to grade programming course exercises.</p>
                        <p>I also wrote some Java code and shell scripts and worked with RabbitMQ and Celery to implement task queuing.</p>

                        <p class="ingress">Jiiri is a time management application with an innovation yet to be seen: Jiiri is able to automatically schedule users' tasks to their calendars as an optimal but realistic execution plan while considering their exsisting calendar events.</p>
                        <p class="ingress">Jiiri was developed as a start-up company of four university students during the summer of 2012. We were unable to execute but after that summer, I could call myself a professional web software developer and an entrepreneur.</p>

                        <p>The idea for Jiiri originated from my own time management problems as a university student. Instead of applying for normal summer jobs, I decided to assemble a team for Jiiri and test myself as an entrepreneur.</p>
                        <p>As the main founder, I had some CEO responsibilities. I learned a lot about customer development, sales, creating a business model and leadership for example.</p>

                        <p>The basis of our technology stack was Django in back-end, Backbone.js in front-end and Tastypie (a REST framework) between them.</p>

                        <p>The most challenging and interesting part of my work was designing and implementing scheduling algorithm. I must emphasise that the algorithm I developed was not anything that you could find in an algorithm design book.</p>
                        <p>The scheduling algorith I wrote is unique and I don't want to publish it yet but I'm willing to show and discuss it if asked.</p>

At that point, Vaihtorinki was trying to launch a web service where small companies could temoporarily hire blue-collar workforce from each other.</p>
                        <p class="ingress">We used the same tech stack as with Jiiri - Django and Backbone.js. I was responsible for the architectural design and development coordination. In this project, the requirements came straight from the CEO and our developer team of three people implemented whatever she asked. During this project, I learned that I prefer developing something that also interests me as a business case.</p>
