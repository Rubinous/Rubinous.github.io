          <h3>About me</h3>

          <p>
            I am a full-stack web software developer driven by the urge for solving the most difficult technical
            challenges of web-based applications, while building products that advance the humankind towards what we see
            in sci-fi movies.
            I value intelligence and communication skills above all else.
            My goal is to become part of something with big potential for making an impact.

      <div class="half-col">
        <p class="ingress"><a class="out" href="http://crowdbooster.com">Crowdbooster</a> is a
          <strong>Y-Combinator</strong> company based in the <strong>Silicon Valley, U.S.A.</strong>.
          Crowdbooster's goal is to help companies increase and measure their performance in social media.
        </p>

        <p class="ingress">
          developing prototypes for new products. I've had the pleasure of having a large variety of tasks in addition to basic coding – software process improvement, architectural design, database design and UX design, to mention a few. Our web application's development stack consisted of Python/Django, MySQL and Javascript/Backbonejs.

          As our current main product, we have been developing an intelligent analytics tool for large Twitter users and
          Facebook Page owners.
          Also, I have been privileged to have a major role in creating a new product from the scratch and
          to deliver it to some of the biggest publishers in the web.
          The product enables publishers to split test what is being shared through Twitter and Facebook share buttons.

        <h3>Web Application Tech Stack</h3>

        <p>Our software product's architecture was fairly complex – we had live background <strong>Celery</strong>
          processes pulling data from <strong>Facbook and Twitter web APIs</strong>, a huge 3 TB <strong>MySQL</strong>
          database with a <strong>Redis</strong> cache and a complex <strong>Javascript/Backbonejs</strong> one page
          browser app backed with <strong>Python/Django</strong> web server.</p>

        <p>For me, the most exiting work tasks have been redesigning parts of the data flow through the architecture for
          better performance, and figuring out and implementing good and innovative design patterns for the
          Javascript/Backbonejs code to improve the browser app's overall quality.</p>

        <h3>The Silicon Valley Experience</h3>

        <p>In this job, I've gotten the opportunity to experience Silicon Valley, the number one place for tech startups
          in the world. I have learned to dream big and to work hard to reach the goals through the excitement towards
          tech, self performance and creating value for the humankind. The experience was possible thanks to Aalto's
          <a href="http://startuplife.fi">Startup Life</a> program.</p>

        <p>For me, working in a startup means constantly weighing priorities. Instead of just taking explicit orders
          from my boss or picking a todo item from the top of the backlog, my mind has gotten used to balancing how fast
          something needs to be done, with what quality and if I should seize the opportunity to learn something new.
          Our team was small, so I am proud to say, that I've had a major role in reaching the company's goals.</p>

      <h2>A+<br/><span class="time">September 2012 - June 2013</span></h2>

      <div class="half-col col-alpha">
        <p class="ingress"><a class="out" href="http://plus.cs.hut.fi">A+</a> is an open-source educational platform
          developed by the research group <a class="out" href="http://cse.aalto.fi/research/groups/letech/">LeTech</a>
          (Learning+Technology) of <a class="out" href="http://www.aalto.fi/en/">Aalto University School of Science</a>.
          The abstract idea of A+ is to hide the different technical requirements for different courses and thus reduce
          the number of educational services that students have to deal with during their studies.</p>

        <p class="ingress">I worked as a research assistant in LeTech as well as the main teaching assistant for the Web
          Software Development course. My job was to deploy A+ to be used on two courses in Aalto and to develop it
          further as new requirements emerged and as bugs and weaknesses were discovered.</p>

        <p class="ingress">The use and development of A+ continues by the LeTech group. The code is hosted in <a
            class="out" href="https://github.com/Aalto-LeTech/a-plus">GitHub</a>.</p>

      <div class="third-col">
        <h3>Scalability and Plug-ins with Django</h3>

        <p>The main focus of my work with A+ was on the Django back-end. Several scalability issues were found as there
          has been hundred thousand exercise submissions to the service after the initial launch. I gained deep
          understanding in ORM while solving those database-related issues.</p>

        <p>Another big thing I did, was designing and implementing a plug-in architecture for A+ to allow the research
          group to build plug-ins related to educational research.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="third-col">
        <h3>Deployment and Linux</h3>

        <p>The deployment and maintenance of A+ and separate grading services lead me to work with the Linux command
          line. For example, I learned to manage linux processes and permissions for secure Apache-based web server
          which was crucial as we had run student-written programs to grade programming course exercises.</p>

        <p>I also wrote some Java code and shell scripts and worked with RabbitMQ and Celery to implement task
          queuing.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="third-col">
        <h3>University-grade Research</h3>

        <p>Most of the people that I worked with at Aalto, were either post-doc researchers or doctoral students. I was
          honored to work with some of the smartest computer scientists in Finland. I learned a lot about doing serious
          university grade research.</p>

      <div class="half-col">
        <p class="ingress">Jiiri is a time management application with an innovation yet to be seen: Jiiri is able to
          automatically schedule users' tasks to their calendars as an optimal but realistic execution plan while
          considering their exsisting calendar events.</p>

        <p class="ingress">Jiiri was developed as a startup company of five university students during the summer of
          2012.</p>

        <h3>Founder of a Startup</h3>

        <p>The idea for Jiiri originated from my own time management problems as a university student. Instead of
          applying for normal summer jobs, I decided to assemble a team for Jiiri with my like-minded friends to test
          ourselves as entrepreneurs.</p>

        <p>In addition to the technical side, I learned a lot about customer development, sales, creating a business
          model, leadership and startups in general.</p>

      <div class="third-col">
        <h3>Full Stack with Django and Backbone.js</h3>

        <p>As the most experienced developer, I was responsible for our software process, architectural design and
          helping other developers with whatever they got stuck with.</p>

        <p>The basis of our technology stack was Django in back-end, Backbone.js in front-end and Tastypie (a REST
          framework) between them. I worked with the whole stack.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="third-col">
        <h3>Designing the Scheduling Algorithm</h3>

        <p>The most challenging and interesting part of my work was designing and implementing the scheduling algorithm.
          The scheduling algorithm I wrote is unique and I don't want to make it public but I'm willing to show and
          discuss it if asked, as I am very proud of my work.</p>

      <h2>Vaihtorinki<br/><span class="time">September 2012 - January 2013</span></h2>

      <div class="half-col">
        <p class="ingress">After the summer 2012, I was hired as a lead developer to a startup company <a class="out"
                                                                                                           href="http://www.vaihtorinki.fi">Vaihtorinki</a>.
          At that point, Vaihtorinki was trying to launch a web service where small companies could temoporarily hire
          blue-collar workforce from each other.</p>

        <p class="ingress">We used the same tech stack as with Jiiri - Django and Backbone.js. I was responsible for the
          architectural design and development coordination. In this project, the requirements came straight from the
          CEO and our developer team of three people implemented whatever she asked.</p>

        <h3>Heavy Javascript Front-end</h3>

        <p>The Vaihtorinki web app was fully dynamic javascript application. I learned to use advanced javascript
          technologies such as marionette.js, require.js and grunt.js to handle the complexity of our front-end
          architecture.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="third-col">
        <h3>Data Interface</h3>

        <p>As all the functional and UI code was in the front-end, the back-end had to provide fast and secure data
          interface with business logic operations. I had to solve data integrity issues between front and back while
          dealing with a poor REST framework called Tastypie, which were my most interesting and challenging
          responsibilities in Vaihtorinki.</p>
