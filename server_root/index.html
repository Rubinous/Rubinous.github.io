            <h2>A+</h2>
            <p>A+ is an educational platform for hosting courses with exercises that are graded by external grading applications/services. The main goal of A+ is to hide the different technical requirements for different courses and thus reduce the number of educational services that university students have to use during their studies.</p>
            <p>A+ is developed by a research group LeTech (Learning+Technology) in Aalto University School of Science and I was working as a research assistant in that group. A+ was initially developed by Teemu Koskinen as part of his master's thesis. My job was to put A+ in to use in Aalto and develop it further as new requirements emerged and as bugs and weaknesses were discovered. The use and development of A+ continues by the LeTech as an open source project. The code is hosted in <a href="https://github.com/Aalto-LeTech/a-plus">GitHub</a>. I was honored to work with computer scientists with doctoral degrees. I learned a lot about doing serious university grade research.</p>
            <p>The main focus of my work with A+ was on the Django back-end. After the initial launch, there has been tens of thousand of exercise submissions to the service so the most challenging task was to improve the interaction with database and scalability of the service. Other big thing I did, was designing and implementing a plug-in architecture for A+ to allow the research group to build plug-ins related to educational research.</p>

            <h2>Jiiri</h2>
            <p>Jiiri is a time management application with an innovation yet to be seen: Jiiri is able to automatically schedule users' tasks to their calendars as events. Jiiri takes considers the free time in users' calendars and deadlines, time estimates and priorities of their tasks and calculates an optimal schedule for completing those tasks. Jiiri was developed as a start-up company. We were a team of four and I was the main founder, CEO and CTO of Jiiri. The development of Jiiri may still continue in the future as I still think it's a great innovation but we decided it is best to get more experience before founding our own start-up.</p>
            <p>The main focus of my work was on designing and implementing the scheduling algorithm. I must emphasise that the algorithm was not anything you could find in an algorithm design book and we were able to find only one other person who had tried anything similar. The scheduling algorith I wrote was unique and I am very proud of my work. As the one that came up with the idea and as the most experienced developer of the team, I also had lots of CEO and CTO responsibilities.</p>

            <h2>Vaihtorinki</h2>
            <p>After Jiiri, three of our team was hired by another start-up company Vaihtorinki. Vaihtorinki tries creat an online marketplace work local temporary blue collar work. The main idea of the service is that anyone in a sudden need of blue collar worker (a cashier for example) would go to <a href="http://www.vaihtorinki.fi">vaihtorinki.fi</a>, find a suitable worker and reserve him for relatively short period of time. The workers are provided by staffing agencies so it is a two-sided market service.</p>
            <p>As the most experienced developer, I was considered the CTO of the company. My main responsibility was to solve the most challenging technical issues and implementation. In the end, I was working for equity and during that time I also did concept design and customer research. However, I quickly learned that this was not the kind of start-up that would light my fire and I dropped out and decided to apply to more ambitious San Francisco based start-ups.</p>
