                        <p>I am a full stack web software developer with backend emphasis. Solving difficult technical and mathematical problems is what really lights my fire but I also claim that I have an excellent business brain right next to that mathematical part. Thus my dream is to work in a start-up company with a technically challenging innovative product.</p>

                        <p class="ingress"><a class="out" href="http://plus.cs.hut.fi">A+</a> is an open-source educational platform developed by the research group <a class="out" href="http://cse.aalto.fi/research/groups/letech/">LeTech</a> (Learning+Technology) of <a class="out" href="http://www.aalto.fi/en/">Aalto University School of Science</a>. The abstract idea of A+ is to hide the different technical requirements for different courses and thus reduce the number of educational services that students have to deal with during their studies.</p>
                        <p class="ingress">I worked as a research assistant in LeTech as well as the main teaching assistant for the Web Software Development course. My job was to deploy A+ to be used on two courses in Aalto and to develop it further as new requirements emerged and as bugs and weaknesses were discovered.</p>
                        <p class="ingress">The use and development of A+ continues by the LeTech group. The code is hosted in <a class="out" href="https://github.com/Aalto-LeTech/a-plus">GitHub</a>.</p>

                        <h3>Scalability and Plug-ins with Django</h3>
                        <p>The main focus of my work with A+ was on the Django back-end. Several scalability issues were found as there has been hundred thousand exercise submissions to the service after the initial launch. I gained deep understanding in ORM while solving those database-related issues.</p>
                        <p>Another big thing I did, was designing and implementing a plug-in architecture for A+ to allow the research group to build plug-ins related to educational research.</p>

                        <p>The deployment and maintenance of A+ and separate grading services lead me to work with the Linux command line. For example, I learned to manage linux processes and permissions for secure Apache-based web server which was crucial as we had run student-written programs to grade programming course exercises.</p>
                        <p>I also wrote some Java code and shell scripts and worked with RabbitMQ and Celery to implement task queuing.</p>

                        <p class="ingress">Jiiri was developed as a start-up company of five university students during the summer of 2012.</p>

                        <p>The idea for Jiiri originated from my own time management problems as a university student. Instead of applying for normal summer jobs, I decided to assemble a team for Jiiri with my like-minded friends to test ourselves as entrepreneurs.</p>
                        <p>In addition to the technical side, I learned a lot about customer development, sales, creating a business model, leadership and startups in general.</p>

                        <p>As the most experienced developer, I was responsible for our software process, architectural design and helping other developers with whatever they got stuck with.</p>
                        <p>The basis of our technology stack was Django in back-end, Backbone.js in front-end and Tastypie (a REST framework) between them. I worked with the whole stack.</p>

                        <p class="ingress">After the summer 2012, I was hired as a lead developer to a start-up company <a class="out" href="http://www.vaihtorinki.fi">Vaihtorinki</a>. At that point, Vaihtorinki was trying to launch a web service where small companies could temoporarily hire blue-collar workforce from each other.</p>
                        <p class="ingress">We used the same tech stack as with Jiiri - Django and Backbone.js. I was responsible for the architectural design and development coordination. In this project, the requirements came straight from the CEO and our developer team of three people implemented whatever she asked.</p>

                        <p>The Vaihtorinki web app was fully dynamic javascript application. I learned to use advanced javascript technologies such as marionette.js, require.js and grunt.js to handle the complexity of our front-end architecture.</p>

                        <p>As all the functional and UI code was in the front-end, the back-end had to provide fast and secure data interface with business logic operations. I had to solve data integrity issues between front and back while dealing with a poor REST framework called Tastypie, which were my most interesting and challenging responsibilities in Vaihtorinki.</p>
